What are async and defer in <script> tags? 🚀
When you include a <script> tag in an HTML file, it blocks the page from rendering until the script is downloaded and executed. To improve performance, we use async and defer to load scripts without blocking the page.

1️⃣ async (Asynchronous Loading)
The script downloads in parallel with the HTML but executes immediately once it's downloaded.
Other scripts and HTML parsing may pause while this script runs.
Used for independent scripts that don't rely on others.

<script src="script.js" async></script>
HTML parsing → Download script asynchronously → Execute script immediately → Continue parsing HTML

2️⃣ defer (Deferred Loading)
The script downloads in parallel with HTML but executes after the HTML is fully parsed.
Maintains execution order if multiple scripts use defer.
Used for scripts that interact with the DOM.

<script src="script.js" defer></script>

HTML parsing → Download script asynchronously → Finish HTML parsing → Execute script in order

When Should You Use async or defer?
✔ Use async when the script doesn’t depend on other scripts (e.g., Google Analytics).
✔ Use defer when the script modifies the DOM or depends on other scripts (e.g., React, jQuery).

Example: Using Both async and defer
html
Copy
Edit
<script src="analytics.js" async></script> <!-- Independent script -->
<script src="react.js" defer></script> <!-- Loads in order -->
<script src="app.js" defer></script> <!-- Executes after HTML is loaded -->

3️⃣ Key Differences: Library vs Framework
Feature	Library 📚 (e.g., React)	Framework 🏗 (e.g., Next.js, Angular)
Control	You control how and when to use it.	The framework controls the flow; it calls your code.
Flexibility	More flexible; you can use it with other tools.	Less flexible; you must follow its rules.
Size & Scope	Small and focused (e.g., UI handling in React).	Large and complete (e.g., full-stack web development in Next.js).
Code Structure	You decide the structure of the app.	The framework enforces a predefined structure.
Dependency	Can be used within any project.	Often requires using only that framework’s ecosystem.


1️⃣ What is a Library? 📚
A library is a collection of reusable code that helps developers perform specific tasks without writing everything from scratch. You control when and how to use the library.

Example: React (Library)
React is a UI library that lets you create components, but you decide how to structure your application.

javascript
Copy
Edit
import React from "react";

const App = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

export default App;
✅ You call React when needed (e.g., React.createElement() or useState()).
✅ Gives flexibility to organize the app structure.

2️⃣ What is a Framework? 🏗
A framework is a complete structure that provides rules and guidelines to build an application. The framework calls your code and dictates how the app should be structured.

Example: Next.js (Framework)
Next.js is a React-based framework that provides routing, server-side rendering, and API handling.

javascript
Copy
Edit
import React from "react";

export default function Home() {
    return <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>;
}
✅ Next.js enforces a structure (e.g., pages/ folder for routing).
✅ You follow the framework’s rules instead of deciding everything yourself.

What is a CDN? 🌍🚀
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a globally distributed network of servers that deliver web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, etc.) to users faster and more efficiently based on their geographical location.

Why Do We Use a CDN? 🤔
✅ Faster Website Loading – Content is served from the nearest server instead of a single central server.
✅ Reduced Server Load – Distributes traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload.
✅ Improved Reliability & Uptime – If one server fails, another takes over.
✅ Better Security – Protects against DDoS attacks and other cyber threats.
✅ Lower Bandwidth Costs – Reduces the amount of data transferred from the main server.
✅ Improved SEO – Faster websites improve Google rankings.

How Does a CDN Work? 🔄
1️⃣ User requests a web page.
2️⃣ The CDN finds the nearest server with cached content.
3️⃣ The nearest CDN server delivers the requested content quickly.

Example of Using a CDN in React
Instead of downloading React manually, you can use a CDN to load it:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
✅ No need to install React via NPM
✅ Faster loading due to global distribution

Popular CDN Providers
1️⃣ Cloudflare CDN 🌐
2️⃣ Akamai CDN
3️⃣ Amazon CloudFront (AWS)
4️⃣ Google Cloud CDN
5️⃣ Microsoft Azure CDN
6️⃣ UNPKG & jsDelivr (for serving NPM packages like React)

When Should You Use a CDN?
✔ Hosting static files (CSS, JS, images, fonts).
✔ Serving large-scale applications with users worldwide.
✔ Reducing server load for high-traffic websites.

What is Cross-Origin? 🌍🔒
Cross-Origin refers to requests made from one domain (origin) to another domain. Web browsers enforce security policies like Same-Origin Policy (SOP) to prevent unauthorized access to data from different domains.
